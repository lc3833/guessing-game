1. HOW TO RUN THE GAME

This game uses modern colors and emojis that the old Windows `cmd.exe` cannot display.
For the best experience, follow these steps:

    1.  Install Java (JRE): Java 8 or newer is required.
    2.  Install Windows Terminal: Can be found on the Microsoft Store or GitHub.
    3.  Running:
        Double-click on the `PLAY.bat` file.

        * The script will automatically detect the environment and launch the game in a new window with colors.
